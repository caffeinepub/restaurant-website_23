  "summary": "The implementation satisfies nearly all requirements. All four pages (Home, Menu, About, Contact) are created with the requested content and functionality. Backend storage and admin editing are implemented for menu prices and contact info. Navigation is functional with active route indication. The warm earth-tone design theme is present. However, the custom index.css appears to override the required warm color palette with grayscale values, and the requested category icons (main-dishes, fast-food, drinks) are used but not explicitly verified as matching the descriptions in the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Design a warm, inviting visual theme for a family-friendly restaurant with a cohesive color palette using warm earth tones (amber, terracotta, cream)",
      "reason": "The frontend/index.css file overrides the warm color palette from frontend/src/index.css with grayscale OKLCH values (lightness values only, no hue/chroma). The overriding index.css uses values like '--background: 1 0 0' and '--primary: 0.205 0 0' which are grayscale, not the warm amber/terracotta/cream tones specified in src/index.css",
